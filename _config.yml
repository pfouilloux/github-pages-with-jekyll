  Hi! Thanks for stopping by. I’m a self-taught software engineer specialising in backend development. 
  I’m passionate about programming as a craft and this is my stab at maintaining a blog. 
  You can expect various ramblings about general working practices, golang, rust and other random things that grab my interest.
